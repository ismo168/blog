I am a digital health researcher and digital project manager working in health information systems and implementation science. I focus on developing and deploying digital solutions adapted to local contexts, improving health information quality and use, and advancing digital health literacy in low-resource settings.

My experience includes designing clinical decision support systems (CDSS), supporting interoperability between health information systems, and coordinating digital health projects from concept to implementation. I combine research, technical development, and strategic coordination to support digital transformation and equitable access to quality health services
